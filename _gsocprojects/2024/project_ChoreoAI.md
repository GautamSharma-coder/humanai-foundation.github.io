description: |
   While AI is re-shaping many facets of life today, its impact on the arts has garnered a particular interest by the general public. AI-generated artistic outputs are growing increasingly sophisticated, but artists themselves are too often left out of the development process for such tools, yielding a stark societal divide between AI developers and the artists who inspire them. Moreover, dance as an artistic discipline has been historically overlooked and misunderstood by the AI community. The mission of this project is to put dancers and technologists directly in conversation to construct radical new tools for AI-enabled choreography that are both state-of-the-art and artist-led.
