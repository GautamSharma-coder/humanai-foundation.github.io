## Introduction

In 2024 HumanAI plans to participate in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization.
The HumanAI organization will broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of arts and humanities fields.
HumanAI participants will be mentored by domain experts and artists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of arts and humanities.
Projects span a wide range of domains, including arts, music, languages, history, choreography, theatre, literature etc.



### For Students


In 2024 GSoC students work with their mentors to produce open-source codes that apply machine learning solutions to artd and humanities. Projects span three evaluation periods that allow for students and mentors to collaborate on their project and evaluate student progress. Detailed rules for the GSOC program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
Interested students should look at the ideas page and contact the mentors. Candidates will be asked to complete an evaluation test for each project they apply to demonstrate the skills needed for the respective projects.
In the next step, students will produce a proposal which will be evaluated for final student selection.  

**Proposals need to be submitted via GSoC portal by TBA**


Please see the [official GSoC Timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
