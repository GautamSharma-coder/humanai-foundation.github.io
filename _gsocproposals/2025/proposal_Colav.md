## Description

The retrieval of academic documents from scientific databases is negatively affected by the
ambiguity of the author’s name.
Different approaches of feature extraction/engineering have been proposed which leverage
mixes of both textual embeddings and graph representations of the papers to calculate their
similarity for the required task of clustering.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
Extract/Construct features from the non-structured and semi-structured paper’s metadata in
order to get useful latent representations. This task could imply simultaneous use of different
network architectures.
Cluster the set of papers in different groups (one group by each author entity in the database)


## Expected results
Train/Test different proposed AI methodologies to extract/construct paper features and to
identify its correct author-entities across the Impactu scientific metadata database.

## Requirements
* Python
* Pytorch/Tensorflow
* Basic knowledge of graph networks and LLMs.

## Project difficulty level
Intermediate
