title:  Coding Actions and Fatalities in Militarized Interstate Confrontations (MICs), 2002 to 2024
layout: gsoc_proposal
project: ISSR
year: 2025
organization:
  - Alabama

---

## Description

This project uses an existing corpus of newspaper articles to derive models that identify (1) whether a MIC occurred, (2) what type of militarized interaction was described, (3) whether fatalities occurred, and (4) the range of fatalities, if any. The newspaper articles have been retrieved based on boolean search terms associated with militarized conflict. However, more than 95% of the articles are false positives for identifying MICs.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
 * Extract and preprocess textual data from the newspaper corpora for NLP analysis.
 * Develop and train NLP models, such as LSTM or BERT, to understand and code the militarized actions and fatalities in each conflict.


## Expected results
 * The successful project will identify newspaper articles that contain MICs and retrieve the conflict participants (initiator and target), the militarized action, and whether how many fatalities (range) occurred.

## Requirements
The project requires the ability to code in Python and knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.

## Project difficulty level
This project has a moderate level of difficulty.
