## Description

Transliteration of text from centuries-old works represents a research area that is underserved by current tools, such as Adobe Acrobatâ€™s OCR. While these resources can perform text recognition from clearly printed modern sources, they are incapable of extracting textual data from early forms of print, much less manuscripts. This project will focus on the application of self-supervised AI models to recognize text in Spanish printed sources from the seventeenth century.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
 * Creation of an self-supervised AI model capable of performing text recognition

## Expected results
 * Machine learning models will be trained to perform text recognition of non-standard printed text
 * AI should be able to extract text with at least 80% accuracy



## Requirements
Python and some previous experience in Machine Learning.

## Difficulty level
Advanced
