## Description

In recent years advanced multispectral and X-ray imaging techniques have allowed art historians and preservation experts to find hidden images beneath famous paintings. These hidden images can have different origins. In some cases they are older paintings or sketches on a canvas that the artist decided to reuse for another painting. Canvases were often resued to save money. In other cases modifications ot the original painting are added to conceal controversial details, or just because the artist changet their mind. We porpose to use artificial intelligence in combination with high quality multispectral data to simplify, automatize, and improve the process of analyzing a painting, indentify its properties and find hidden images.  

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
 * Extract useful information from multispectral images of paintings, pigment type, damage, previous restorations.
 * Find if the painting contains a hidden image that has been painted over.

## Expected results
 * Prepare a dataset of multi spectral images of paintings.
 * Train a CNN to identify painting properties
 * Train a CNN to identify images hidden beneath paintings
 * (If time premits) train an AI model to retrieve the hidden image.

## Requirements
 * Python
 * PyTorch/TensorFlow
 * Experience with CNNs


## Project difficulty level
Medium
