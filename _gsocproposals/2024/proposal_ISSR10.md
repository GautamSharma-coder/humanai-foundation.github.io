title:  Estimating Fatality Range in Military Incidents - Leveraging AI for Determining Casualties in Cross-border Conflicts

## Description

This project would use an AI-based model to determine the range of fatalities in an MIE. There is often uncertainty in reports of conflict, and this project would help determine whether a military fatality was caused by another countryâ€™s military and then develop a likely range of how many soldiers were killed. Two variables would be coded: the minimum and maximum fatalities in the MIE.
