title:  Investigating Conflict-related Fatalities in News Articles

## Description

This project uses the articles we have retrieved for the 2002-2014 period and determines whether the article describes at least one person getting killed, whether the fatality was in a country’s military, and whether the fatality was caused by another country’s military. The easier coding approach for this project would be to determine search rules and apply them to the articles and continually update those rules until accuracy is acceptable. A more difficult, but potentially better, approach would train an AI-based model.
