## Description

The National Center for Educational Statistics includes a nationally representative study of Bachelor degree recipients who were surveyed at the time of graduation, one year after graduation, four years after graduation, and ten years after graduation. It includes four cohorts of students with the most recent graduating in 2016. This “big data” will used to examine theoretically based predictions for gender differences in post-baccalaureate outcomes that are grounded in the tenants of goal congruity theory (Diekman & Steinberg, 2013) and role congruity theory (Diekman & Eagly, 2008).  For example, men and women who enter into majors and careers in which their gender is a minority (e.g., women in engineering, men in nursing) will be most likely to change careers; the changes will coincide with other milestones in the emerging adulthood period (22-30 years) that demark the enactment of new roles,  especially starting a family. This work is important because workforce shortages in many high demand fields (e.g., computing, engineering, nursing, education) are in fields that are highly gender segregated. If we can understand factors that affect perseverance in these occupations, we may be able to address the workforce shortages.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours

## Task ideas
  * Identify which data time points in each cohort that might align with transition points in the emerging adulthood period
  * Identify longitudinal variables that would reflect role transitions
  * Develop a set of metrics based in US labor statistics that can be used to determine masculine and feminine occupations
  * Review data analytic approaches to represent transitions.
    
## Expected results
 * A working model that predicts factors affecting workforce shortages in gender segregated, high demand fields of study (e.g., computing, engineering, nursing, education).

## Requirements
Data reduction and data analytics (multilevel, longitudinal, multivariate modeling)

## Project difficulty level
Intermediate to Easy
